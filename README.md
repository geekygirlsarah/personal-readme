# **README - Sarah Withee**

---

## **Intro**

**Name pronunciation:** SAIR-uh WITH-ee

**Pronouns:** she/her

**Role at CODE PA:** Head of Backend Development

**When you started at CODE PA:** July 17, 2023

**Location:** Pittsburgh, PA

**Schedule/working hours:** 9:00am - 4:30pm EST
(I am flexible but _not_ an early morning person)

**If there's multiple Sara(h)s:** Use Sarah W, SW, or some other reference including my first name/initial. Don't use just my last name ("Withee") as it sounds too much like sports or military references and I don't like it.

If you have questions about anything, leave a work DM and I'll try to clarify!

## **Work style preferences**

### Scheduling

- Any open calendar spot between 9:00am and 4:30pm ET is fair game for booking me.
- If my calendar time is marked as "(Personal)", ask before booking it. I might be able to reschedule it.
- If my calendar time is marked as "(Optional)" or shows up as free, go ahead and book it!
- I am not a great morning person and am generally more functional in the afternoon. Late mornings are great for standups or catch-up meetings, afternoons will usually be when I get the most work done, or can contribute the most thoughtful discussions.
- Try to book meetings back to back, or leave room with at least an hour in between. (It takes me a bit of time to get back into "the zone" so it helps to eliminate short breaks between meetings that I can't really get back into a productive flow.)

### Meeting interactions

- I am sometimes quiet in discussion meetings. It doesn't mean I don't have thoughts, but often means I have a bunch of thoughts and other people are saying them first (so no reason to duplicate), I'm presently still brewing on a larger idea, or I'm trying to formulate how to turn my idea into words. My quietness doesn't mean I don't have any thoughts or anything to say!
- If the meeting is too early in the morning (for me), I may join but just leave my camera off.
- If you catch me immediately looking frantic on a video call, or I start messing with my phone quickly, it's probably alerting me that my blood sugar is going out of control. I'll still be listening, but it usually means I have a current health issue or soon to be health issue. (Feel free to ask me about how type 1 diabetes, blood sugar control, or my DIY open source artificial pancreas works! I'm not shy about it.)

### Actively working

- I am fine working solo or pair programming
- I am more than happy to jump on calls with others to help think through problems or "writers" (developers?) block
- If I'm deep in thought and you interrupt, that's ok, but let me finish dumping my thoughts to a point I know where to resume so I can pay better attention to your needs.
- If I'm regularly interrupted, I may just block off time on the calendar dedicated to work.

### Communication

- I am fine communicating over email, Slack/Teams, chat, Meet/Zoom, or other methods
- I probably will respond to Slack/Teams the fastest
- If there's a hole in my calendar, you are welcome to start video meeting with me

### Feedback

- I highly value feedback as a fellow teammate and coworker, and will gladly offer it as best I can if desired! I truly think I learn and grow as a developer and a person through good, thoughtful feedback processes!

#### Receiving feedback

- I generally prefer honest, direct feedback.
- I generally prefer regular feedback delivered more often than less. (I think less often means stuff gets missed.)
- If feedback is mixed in with non-feedback, I might miss it or it might not always come off as important as it should be.
- I prefer feedback to be as constructive as possible, talking about situations and events that happened rather than broad or vague descriptions. (i.e. "When you worked on X, you did Y, which was/wasn't good." instead of "You don't do Y well.")
- If you have positive and negative feedback, please give both. (Order is less important than actually giving both.)
- If you have only negative feedback, that's ok, but if I'm delivered only negative feedback for an extended period of time, I will probably fall into a negative mental state and need a day to recover.
- I am willing to receive feedback via video call, Slack/Team messages, documents, or any other form of communication.

#### Giving feedback

- I prefer to also give constructive feedback as much as possible, and in as much of a blameless way as possible. (I understand a lot of situations are systemic in problems and want to take some of those into effect.)
- I can offer feedback as often as desired. If asked, I'd probably rather deliver it more often.
- I can offer feedback in any form for your preference. (Video call, Slack message, document, or other form)

## **Skills**

I consider myself a generalist and a polyglot. I've used a LOT of things over the years. I don't feel I'm necessarily an expert on any one thing, but because I've used so many things enough to get a basic understanding, I can usually hit the ground running quickly with about anything (a skill in and of itself). I gravitate towards interesting and challenging projects over reusing technical skills I already know. I also don't have a favorite language and prefer the right language for the task at hand.

A pretty good list (that may not be complete):

- Languages (used in production): Python, JavaScript, PHP, C++, C#, Java, Scala, SQL, Ruby, HTML, CSS
- Languages (experimented with or just old): Haskell, Rust, Visual Basic
- Frameworks: Django, jQuery, Node.js, Express, Symfony, ExtJS, Android, Twilio, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll
- Cloud/CI/CD: Heroku, Travis CI, AWS, Azure, Terraform, AppVeyor
- Databases: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB/NoSQL
- Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Subversion (SVN), Team Foundation Server
- While I mostly work in code, I do like working across the full process of doing software. (So thinking through tech stacks, thinking through architecture, writing code, setting up CI/CD, etc.)
- I've worked on desktop software, mobile software, web software, and server software.
- On past teams, I have developed, tested, done DevOps, collaborated directly with non-technical clients, architected projects, designed database schemas, done project management and been scrummaster, mentored junior employees, and more.

## **Projects I've worked on**

Feel free to chat with me about any of these!

### At CODE PA

Will fill in as I work on them!

### At TTS/18F (federal government)

- I was on the Federal Audit Clearinghouse 10x phase 4 project. (See #10x-grant-reporting or [GitHub](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/tts-staffing/issues/8))
- I was on the Dept of State Educational and Cultural Affairs site migration PA and E&I. (See [GitHub](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues/835))
- I was on an internal 18F team that worked on improving the projects we had, which included (but not limited to) fixing some issues with the internal timesheet tool and integrating the 10 guides into one shared infrastructure 

### Work pre-government

- I did full-stack dev at a company that did data analytics for farmland to help growers get better yield from crops
- I did some contract backend server and frontend mobile app work for a non-profit that was trying to optimize how people reported health data to doctors
- I did some contract backend dev work at a company that was trying to evolve how messages and interactivity happened on forums, trainings, etc.
- I did some full-stack dev work at a healthcare analytics company trying to help them build a system for securely bringing an entire healthcare clinic's database into a data warehouse for processing
- I did some full-stack dev work at a medical research facility to help scientists that did cellular research store and work with data, tests, equipment, scheduling, and more
- I did some full-stack dev work at a regional bank doing a variety of short-term projects in metrics aggregation, third party loan document generations, and notification systems for customer-driven events

## **Hobbies and interests**

Feel free to chat with me about anything below!

- You probably already have noticed my puns, bad jokes, and sarcasm
- I'm probably most famous for my two large, human-loving, social, friendly cats. You will see them on video meetings. They may use me as their human cat tree.
- I mentor an all-girls FIRST robotics competition team (middle and high school), and they went to the world championship in 2022.
- I currently work on an open source polyglot developer reference tool that lets you look at programming structures side by side for a language you know and one you don't, or just any two you want to compare. (And now over 90 contributors!)
- I do try to live stream work on that project on Twitch (though don't have a regular schedule right now)
- I do like swimming and bicycling, and in 2020 rode over 270 miles
- Occasionally I make handmade soap (and since I can't sell it I usually just give a lot of it away)
- I am on a current streak to try to play all Legend of Zelda games in release order. (I just beat Skyward Sword, so I'm jumping between Link Between Worlds and Tears of the Kingdom)
- I also regularly play Splatoon 2 multiplayer games on the Nintendo Switch
- I used to be on a college robotics competition team and programming competition team. I still tinker with hardware/electronics when I can.
- I do really like fashion, and used to wear great outfits, but the pandemic has slowed that down. (Maybe #discuss-fashion can get me back into it?)
- Probably other things
